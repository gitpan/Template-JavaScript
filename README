DESCRIPTION
    This is a very simple template to JavaScript compiler. We compile either
    templates passed in as strings or as a file with Template Toolkit, so
    you can do includes etc. like Template normally does it.

    Once Template has run we apply our own syntax, which is that any line
    beginning with "%" is JavaScript and any other line is output verbatim.

    After the compilation phase (which you can cache) we execute the
    template with JavaScript::V8. So your templates will run very fast in
    the V8 JIT. We provide ways to pass variables and functions back & forth
    to JavaScript::V8 through its normal facilities.
